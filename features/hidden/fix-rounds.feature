    And the scenario "features/base.feature" with 1 scenarios

  Scenario: Two findings, one on the code and one on a step, get both fix rounds
    Given I run "gdd new-change c1 --title App --paths src/app.txt"
    And the Reviewer finds "F1 · off by one · src/app.txt:2 · drops a line\nF2 · weak step · tests/steps/app.txt:7 · asserts nothing", says KO, and then OK
    When I run "gdd launch c1"
    Then it succeeds
    And the agents were called in this order:
